          The era of AI, often referred to as the "AI Age" or "AI Revolution,"
          marks a transformative period characterized by the rapid advancement
          and integration of artificial intelligence technologies into various
          aspects of human life. This era has witnessed exponential growth in AI
          research, development, and deployment across industries such as
          healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Key milestones
          include:
        </p>
        <ul class="technology__list">
          <li>breakthroughs in machine learning</li>
          <li>deep learning</li>
          <li>natural language processing</li>
          <li>computer vision</li>
          <li>robotics</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="technology__p">
          leading to the creation of intelligent systems capable of performing
          complex tasks previously thought to be exclusive to human cognition.
          Ethical and societal implications, such as job displacement, data
          privacy, and algorithmic bias, have also emerged as central concerns
          during this era. Overall, the era of AI represents a profound shift in
          how humans interact with technology, promising both unprecedented
          opportunities and challenges for the future.

          Nature encompasses the entirety of the physical world, including all
          living organisms, ecosystems, geological formations, and natural
          phenomena. It encompasses the diverse array of landscapes, climates,
          and habitats found on Earth, from dense rainforests to expansive
          deserts. Nature provides essential resources such as clean air, water,
          and food, supporting the survival and well-being of all species,
          including humans. It also serves as a source of inspiration, beauty,
          and recreation, fostering a deep connection between individuals and
          the environment. However, human activities, such as pollution,
          deforestation, and climate change, threaten the delicate balance of
          nature, endangering biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Preserving
          and respecting nature is crucial for sustaining life on Earth and
          ensuring a harmonious coexistence between humans and the natural
          world.

          created by Alfredo di Lelio in the early 20th century.
